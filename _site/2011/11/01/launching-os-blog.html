    <p>I&#8217;ve decided to take blogging seriously.</p>

<p>Last week, I purchased the beta of <a href='http://technicalblogging.com/'><em>Technical Blogging</em></a> and began formulating my attack plan. Originally, I had planned to use this domain, rs.io, as the foundation for an attempt at serious blogging, but I eventually discarded that idea, since io domains don&#8217;t rank well in Google, &#8220;rs&#8221; isn&#8217;t a keyword, and I didn&#8217;t want to go through the hassle of rebranding this domain.</p>

<p>The first decision that <em>Technical Blogging</em> recommends you make is deciding on a niche to target. I had a hell of a time figuring out what topic I could 1) write at least 30 articles about, 2) wasn&#8217;t super competitive, and 3) I&#8217;m an expert in. I spent a couple of hours agonizing over this, then it hit me.</p>

<p>Operating systems! I&#8217;m going to write about operating systems! See, I love operating systems. I love reading about &#8216;em. I love thinking about &#8216;em. I learned to program in C so that I could build my own operating system.</p>

<p>With my niche decided, I sought out the perfect URL. I wanted osblog.com, but it&#8217;s parked by GoDaddy. I tried to track down the guy that owns it, but he hasn&#8217;t responded to my email, so I registered http://os-blog.com.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve written 3 articles so far, so it&#8217;s time to officially announce <a href='http://os-blog.com'>OS Blog</a> and add a link to it under Projects in the sidebar.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m currently working on a series of posts that will serve as an introduction to the assembly programming that you&#8217;ll need to know if you want to write your own operating system and, once I&#8217;m finished, I&#8217;m going to follow it up with a series of tutorials on building your own operating system. I&#8217;m also working on a piece about the history of Unix. I have lots of other stuff planned.</p>
