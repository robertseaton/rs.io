title: Let's Try Talking
layout: post

Lips move and sound happens, <br />
Words come together, sentences form, <br />
But communication never occurs, <br />
Nothing transfers. <br />

One party to another: <br />
Talking, waving, motioning, <br />
Eyes wide, mouth agape, <br />
Ears closed. <br />

Want connection? Meet rejection! <br />
No true things are ever spoken. <br />
Feel some feelings, don't try sharing, <br />
Talk about the things you're wearing. <br />

A whisper, scream, or in between, <br />
If what you're saying: *it's important!* <br />
Just remember, they're only playing -- <br />
an expected part, one they're portraying. <br />
