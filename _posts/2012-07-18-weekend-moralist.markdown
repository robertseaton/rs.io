It's midnight. I'm wide awake. I won't be sleeping tonight. I have the movie *Alien* streaming on the television via the Boxee Box, but I haven't been paying any attention. I have only the vaguest notion of what's going on. I know they're on a spaceship and that they're being attacked by some parasitic life form. From the film's title and the creature's appearance, I gather (quite astutely) it's an alien.

I'm drinking coffee. The mug is off-white and curved, non-traditional. A sort of faux-retro look that could be described as "modern." The irony does not fail to make an impression on me. 

I've just swallowed two round red pills of acetamo-something for a headache, which the coffee is exacerbating. I keep drinking it, regardless.

Whenever some woman -- it's always a woman -- tells me that she's addicted to caffeine or Facebook or shopping or reality television or one of a million other banal, modern vices, I visualize the word imbecile tattooed across her forehead. Our society glorifies addiction, impulsiveness, instant gratification, the one-click checkout. Temperance: a cardinal virtue? Nah, a relic of the Victorian era.

Our religions are no longer religion. Our religions are hobbies. Nietzsche had it wrong. God isn't dead. He's a dilettante, a dabbler, a weekend moralist.
