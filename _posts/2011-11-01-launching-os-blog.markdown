I've decided to take blogging seriously.

Last week, I purchased the beta of [*Technical Blogging*](http://technicalblogging.com/) and began formulating my attack plan. Originally, I had planned to use this domain, rs.io, as the foundation for an attempt at serious blogging, but I eventually discarded that idea, since io domains don't rank well in Google, "rs" isn't a keyword, and I didn't want to go through the hassle of rebranding this domain.

The first decision that *Technical Blogging* recommends you make is deciding on a niche to target. I had a hell of a time figuring out what topic I could 1) write at least 30 articles about, 2) wasn't super competitive, and 3) I'm an expert in. I spent a couple of hours agonizing over this, then it hit me.

Operating systems! I'm going to write about operating systems! See, I love operating systems. I love reading about 'em. I love thinking about 'em. I learned to program in C so that I could build my own operating system. 

With my niche decided, I sought out the perfect URL. I wanted osblog.com, but it's parked by GoDaddy. I tried to track down the guy that owns it, but he hasn't responded to my email, so I registered http://os-blog.com.

I've written 3 articles so far, so it's time to officially announce <a href="http://os-blog.com">OS Blog</a> and add a link to it under Projects in the sidebar. 

I'm currently working on a series of posts that will serve as an introduction to the assembly programming that you'll need to know if you want to write your own operating system and, once I'm finished, I'm going to follow it up with a series  of tutorials on building your own operating system. I'm also working on a piece about the history of Unix. I have lots of other stuff planned.
