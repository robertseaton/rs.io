<p>I have been punched in the brain by @robbseaton and his amazing blog, do yourself a favour.</p>

<p><span id="quote-attribute">â€”Ben Keenan</span></p>

<p>Hey, thanks for visiting! My name is Robert Seaton, and I&#8217;ve written everything on this website.</p>

<p>I sometimes get this mad urge and I think to myself, &#8220;You know, I should really write a &#8216;philosophy of blog&#8217; page. I&#8217;ll lay out everything on it. I&#8217;ll tell people all of my ideological assumptions &#8212; about how beliefs are probabilities, the importance of evidence, and how I feel about god and ethics and where I fall on the political spectrum and&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then that other module of my brain pipes up &#8212; the one that&#8217;s in charge of The Department of Only Doing Reasonable Things &#8212; and this part of my brain says something like, &#8220;Pop quiz. You know what a philosophy of blog is colloquially referred to as? It&#8217;s a manifesto. Writing a philosophy for your blog is something that bona fide crazy people do. Terrible idea, sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I never do get around to writing a philosophy of blog. This about page will have to suffice.</p>

<h2 id="about-this-website">About This Website</h2>

<p>Here is how the content on this site generally operates.</p>

<ol>
<li>I become curious about some real-world problem that concerns many people &#8212; stuff like diet, exercise, attraction, optimal goal pursuit, etc.</li>
<li>I go to Google Scholar and download a bunch of relevant scientific research.</li>
<li>I read this research and maybe a textbook or two.</li>
<li>Then I write up everything I learned and how readers can use this information to improve their own lives &#8212; the practical takeaway.</li>
</ol>

<p>This site is all about reviewing all available evidence in the pursuit of building better lives. For a good example of this, check out my article on <a href="http://rs.io/prolonged-eye-contact-attraction-science-tells-us/">prolonged eye contact</a>.</p>

<p>I also sometimes write up highly speculative theories about different phenomena, such as my post on <a href="http://rs.io/what-makes-something-interesting/">what makes something interesting</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re the kind of person who&#8217;s interested in this sort of thing, the best way to keep up with the site is by subscribing via email. It&#8217;s free, and I&#8217;ll alert you whenever new content goes out. Plus, email subscribers receive all kinds of bonus perks: exclusive articles, discounts on any future products I release, and more.</p>

<p>Seriously, join the email list. It&#8217;s awesome. There are hundreds of wonderful people on it, and you&#8217;re wonderful, too! You won&#8217;t regret it. It&#8217;s about 2 emails per week. Here&#8217;s the signup form:</p>

<div class="about-2">
  <center>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary btn-lg btn-popup-about" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#prefooter-signup-modal" onclick="$('subscribe_popup').bPopup();">JOIN US</button>&nbsp;<br />
  </center>
</div>

<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>Like I mentioned, my name is Robert Seaton, but most people call me Robb &#8212; which means that, if you preface your emails to me with &#8220;Hey, Robb&#8221; you&#8217;re more likely to get a response, because I will mistake you for someone I already know. Because psychology. Pretty great, right?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a mostly normal person. I&#8217;m not an academic, but I like to joke that I play one on the internet. I&#8217;m based just outside of Chicago.</p>

<p>I write the sort of articles that I write because I&#8217;ve been burned so many times in the past by forming opinions based on too little data. Whatever mistakes you&#8217;ve made, I&#8217;ve made plenty of my own, and I&#8217;m going to make more. Probably I&#8217;m making some as I write this. But I&#8217;m firmly of the opinion that, in order to make fewer unnecessary mistakes, you first need to ask yourself, &#8220;Who&#8217;s giant shoulders can I be standing on?&#8221;</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve answered that question, grab everything that person has written and scale your way up to their shoulders. Once you&#8217;re there, you can start making original, worthwhile mistakes.</p>

<p>Seriously: if you have a goal, why wouldn&#8217;t you start by gathering all relevant information for achieving said goal?</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>If that sounds like a reasonable plan, you, yeah, <em>you</em>, should jump onto my email newsletter. It&#8217;s awesome. Everyone loves it. If you don&#8217;t, you can leave whenever (but I&#8217;ll feel bad about it).</p>
