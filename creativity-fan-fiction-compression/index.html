  <h1>Creativity, Fan Fiction, and Compression</h1>
  <time datetime=2014-04-04T20:56:56Z class="post-date">Fri, Apr 4, 2014</time>
  

<p>I&#8217;ve written <a href="https://rs.io/creativity-literature-compression/">before</a> about <a href="https://rs.io/what-makes-something-interesting/">the relationship between creativity and compressibility</a>. To recap, a creative work is one that violates expectations, while a compressible statement is one that&#8217;s expected.</p>

<p>For instance, consider two sentences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where there&#8217;s a will, there&#8217;s a way.</li>
<li>Where there&#8217;s a will, there&#8217;s a family fighting over it.</li>
</ul>

<p>I suspect you find the second more creative.</p>

<p>Three more examples of creative sentences:</p>

<ul>
<li>When I was a kid, my parents moved a lot. But I always found them.</li>
<li>Dad always said laughter is the best medicine, which is why several of us died of tuberculosis.</li>
<li>A girl phoned me the other day and said, &#8220;Come on over, there&#8217;s nobody home.&#8221; I went over. Nobody was home.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given that less predictable sentences are more creative, and less predictable sentences are less compressible, creative works ought to be less compressible than non-creative ones. And, indeed, I found some evidence for this in <a href="https://rs.io/creativity-literature-compression/">a previous experiment</a>.</p>

<p>But that was not too compelling as it compared technical, repetitive works to novels. This time, I decided to compare very creative writing to normal creative writing.</p>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>

<p><strong>The idea then is to compare the compressibility of amateur creative writing with that of experts.</strong> To accomplish this, I took 95 of the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top">top 100 most downloaded</a> works from Project Gutenberg. I figure that these count as very creative works given that they&#8217;re still popular now, ~100 years later. For amateur writing, I downloaded <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Extraordinary-Fanfiction-Novels/85665/">107 fanfiction novels listed as &#8220;extraordinary&#8221;</a> from fanfiction.net.</p>

<p>I then selected the strongest open source text compression algorithm, as ranked by <a href="http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text.html">Matt Mahoney&#8217;s compression benchmark</a> &#8212; <a href="https://github.com/robertseaton/paq8pxd">paq8pxd</a>. I ran each work through the strongest level of compression, and then compared the ratio of compressed to uncompressed space for each work.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-and-results">Analysis and Results</h2>

<p>I plotted the data and examined the outliers, which turned out to be compressed files that my script incorrectly grabbed from Project Gutenberg. I removed these from the analysis, and produced this:</p>

<p><a href="https://rs.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fanfic-graph1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-425" src="https://rs.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fanfic-graph1.png" alt="fanfic-graph1" width="527" height="439" srcset="https://rs.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fanfic-graph1.png 527w, https://rs.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fanfic-graph1-300x249.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" /></a></p>

<p>Here the red dots are fanfiction novels, while the blue-ish ones are classic works of literature. <strong>If the hypothesis were true, we&#8217;d expect them to fall into distinct clusters. They don&#8217;t.</strong></p>

<p>Comparing compressibility alone produces this:</p>

<p><a href="https://rs.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fanfic-graph2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-424" src="https://rs.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fanfic-graph2.png" alt="fanfic-graph2" width="485" height="369" srcset="https://rs.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fanfic-graph2.png 485w, https://rs.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fanfic-graph2-300x228.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /></a></p>

<p>Again, no clear grouping.</p>

<p>Finally, I applied a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test">Student&#8217;s t test</a> to the data, which should tell us if the two data sets are distinguishable mathematically. Based on the graphs, intuition says it won&#8217;t, and indeed it doesn&#8217;t:</p>

<pre class="lang:r decode:true ">Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  dat$RATIO by dat$CLASS
t = -1.3614, df = 144.26, p-value = 0.1755
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.009924785  0.001828882
sample estimates:
    mean in group  FANFIC mean in group  LITERATURE 
                0.2230189                 0.2270668</pre>

<p><strong>The p-value here is 0.1755, which is not statistical significance.</strong> The code and data necessary to reproduce this are available <a href="https://github.com/robertseaton/fanfic-analysis">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>I must admit a certain amount of disappointment that we weren&#8217;t able to distinguish between literature and fanfiction by compressiblity. That would have been pretty neat.</p>

<p><strong>So, what does this failure mean? There at least six hypothesis that get a boost based on this evidence:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Creativity and compression are unrelated.</li>
<li>A view of humans as compressors is wrong.</li>
<li>Human compression algorithms (the mind) and machine compression algorithms are distinct to the point where one cannot act as a proxy for the other.</li>
<li>Compression algorithms are still too crude to detect subtle differences.</li>
<li>Fanfiction is as creative as literature.</li>
</ul>

<p>And so on and, of course, it&#8217;s possible that I messed up the analysis somewhere.</p>

<p>Of all of these, my preferred explanation is that compression technology (and hardware) are not yet good enough. Consider, again, the difference between a creative and a not-creative sentence:</p>

<ul>
<li>Honesty is the best policy.</li>

<li><p>I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather&#8230; not screaming and</p>

<p>yelling like the passengers in his car.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The first is boring, right? Why? Because we&#8217;ve heard it before. It&#8217;s compressible &#8212; but how&#8217;s a compression algorithm supposed to know that? Well, maybe if we trained it on a corpus of the English language, gave it the sort of experience that <em>we</em> have, then it might be able to identify a cliche.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s not how compression works <em>right now</em>. I mean, sure, some have certain models of language, but nothing approaching the memory that a human has, which is where &#8220;human as computer compression algorithm&#8221; breaks down. Even with the right algorithm &#8212; maybe we already know it &#8212; the hardware isn&#8217;t there.</p>

<p>Scientific American <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-memory-capacity/?page=1">estimates</a> that the brain has a storage capacity of about 2.5 petabytes, which is sort of hand-wavy and I&#8217;d bet on the high side, but every estimate I&#8217;ve seen puts the brain at more than 4 gigabytes, by at least a couple orders of magnitude. I don&#8217;t know of any compressors that use memory anywhere near that, and certainly none that use anything like 2.5 petabytes. At the very least, we&#8217;re limited by hardware here.</p>

<p>But don&#8217;t just listen to me. Make up your own mind.</p>

<li>The idea that kicked off this whole line of inquiry is Jürgen Schmidhuber&#8217;s theory of creativity, which<a href="https://rs.io/what-makes-something-interesting/">I&#8217;ve written up</a>. If you prefer, <a href="http://vimeo.com/7441291">here&#8217;s the man himself</a> giving a talk on the subject.</li>
<li>To reproduce what I&#8217;ve done here, <a href="https://github.com/robertseaton/fanfic-analysis">everything is on GitHub</a>. That repository is also a good place to download the top 100 Gutenberg novels in text form, as rate-limiting makes scraping them a multi-day affair.</li>
<li>I similarly compared technical writing and creative writing in <a href="https://rs.io/creativity-literature-compression/">this post</a> and <em>did</em> find that technical writing was more compressible.</li>
