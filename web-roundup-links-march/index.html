  <ul>
<li><p>To score drugs, <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/03/sentences-to-ponder-heroin-markets-in-everywhere.html">try a support group for addicts.</a></p></li>

<li><p>Teenage pregnancy &#8212; not <em>that</em> big of a deal? <a href="http://people.bu.edu/lang/teenpreg.pdf">&#8220;Our results reinforce recent research that finds at most modest adverse causal effects of teen births on the mothers&#8217; adult outcomes.&#8221;</a> <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/03/the_modest_prob.html">Summary.</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/03/your-porn-is-not-canadian-enough.html">The Canadian FCC has reprimanded a Toronto-based TV channel for not broadcasting enough Canadian porn.</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.ergo-log.com/women-find-fast-cyclists-attractive.html">The genes of men who make good cyclists also make them good looking, concludes biologist Erik Postma.</a> The effect size is stronger for women not on contraceptives, providing more evidence that <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/birth-control-pills-affect-womens-taste/">birth control is doing funky things to human attraction</a>. (HT: <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/03/assorted-links-1075.html">Tyler Cowen</a>.)</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/william-shockley-on-what-makes-a-person-write-a-lot-of-papers-and-the-superstar-researcher-system/">A hurdle model for scientific productivity.</a> In short, there are 8 factors that contribute to scientific productivity. If one is decent at all 8, one will be much more productive than other scientists, and weakness at any one is a sort of choke point. (HT: <a href="http://www.gwern.net/">gwern</a>.)</p></li>

<li><p>The structure of the hurdle model reminds me of the &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter">Great Filter</a>&#8221; solution to the Fermi Paradox. Intelligent life is rare because it has to travel through so many filters and there are few megaproductive scientists for the same-ish reasons.</p></li>

<li><p>During the first 15 years after publication, the median paper is cited 1 time. (Data <a href="http://physics.bu.edu/~redner/projects/citation/isi.html">here</a>.) <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file27330.pdf">More than a third of all published papers go uncited.</a></p></li>

<li><p>The CDC has put together a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombies.htm">zombie preparedness strategy</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/10/study-writers-are-twice-as-likely-to-commit-suicide/263833/">&#8220;Authors were also almost twice as likely to commit suicide as the general population.&#8221;</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2014/03/10/gesturing-hands-powerful-tool-children-s-math-learning">Children instructed to gesture with their hands while learning mathematics gain a deeper and more flexible understanding of the material.</a> Fields Medalist Terry Tao describes this sorta thing in <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/38639/thinking-and-explaining">a MathOverflow answer</a>, &#8220;In one extreme case, I ended up rolling around on the floor with my eyes closed in order to understand the effect of a gauge transformation that was based on this type of interaction between different frequencies.&#8221;</p></li>

<li><p>Familiar with the studies that say cohabiting before marriage predicts divorce? <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/best-predictor-divorce-age-couples-cohabit-study-says-131122832.html">Well, that&#8217;s maybe wrong.</a> This newer study suggests that it&#8217;s the age at which people cohabit that matters, not living together in general.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://soyourlifeismeaningless.com">A webcomic for nihilists.</a> I like it. I think I&#8217;m going to go stare at the output of my random number generator for a while now.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/epiphany">Aaron Swartz details the viewquake he experienced after reading Chomsky&#8217;s <em>Understanding Power</em>.</a> I&#8217;ve added it to my to-read list, even though progressives talk about Chomsky like some sort of religious prophet, while AI guys usually call him the worst word they know &#8212; postmodernist.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.1911v1.pdf">Candy Crush is NP-hard.</a> As is <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4995">Pac-man, Tron, Doom, Starcraft,</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1895">Super Mario Brothers, Donkey Kong, and Pokemon</a>. (HT: <a href="http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/03/15/could-we-have-felt-evidence-for-sdp-p/">Pip</a>, <a href="http://jeremykun.com/2014/03/17/want-to-make-a-great-puzzle-game-get-inspired-by-theoretical-computer-science/">Jeremy Kun</a>.)</p></li>

<li><p>&#8220;Alcohol advertisements don&#8217;t just get consumers to switch from one brand to another. <a href="http://a-nice-place-to-live.blogspot.com/2014/03/alcohol-advertising-works.html">They also increase total drinking among youth aged 15-26.</a>&#8220;</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/agi@v2.listbox.com/msg03447.html">The brain is a lossy compressor</a>: &#8220;I realize it is tempting to use lossy text compression as a test for AI because that is what the human brain does when we read text and recall it in paraphrased fashion. We remember the ideas and discard details about the <em>expression</em> of those ideas.&#8221;</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://cis.org/MailOrderBrides">&#8220;Marriages arranged through the mail-order services would appear to have a lower divorce rate than the nation as a whole, fully 80 percent of these marriages having lasted over the years for which reports are available.&#8221;</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail-order_bride">Insight from Wikipedia</a>: There is a discrepancy between how international adoptions are regarded (&#8220;saving a child&#8221;) and how international marriages are regarded (&#8220;buying a wife&#8221;).</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2580828/Could-soon-create-hell-EARTH-Biotechnology-let-extend-criminals-lives-makes-suffering-HUNDREDS-years.html">The overlap between &#8220;ethicist&#8221; and evil genius</a>: &#8220;Turning to human engineering as a possible solution, Dr. Roache looks at the idea of life span enhancements so that a life sentence in prison could last hundreds of years. Another scenario being explored by the group is uploading the criminal&#8217;s mind to a digital realm to speed up the 1,000 year sentence.&#8221;</p></li>

<li><p>A <a href="http://www.wellsortedversion.com/#gallery">&#8220;well-sorted&#8221; version of the King James Bible</a>, where all the letters have been, well, sorted. &#8220;The Well-Sorted Version captured my imagination because it recreates the alienation I felt trying to reconcile the reputation and contents of the Bible.&#8221;</p></li>

<li><p>Ever wonder how data compression works? (You ought to if you&#8217;ve read my post on the <a href="https://rs.io/what-makes-something-interesting/">relationship between compressibility, interestingness, and creativity</a>.) Scott Vokes gave a presentation on the topic at Strange Loop and <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/zip-code">the talk</a> is now online.</p></li>

<li><p>Golden rice is rice spliced with carrot genes. It has superior nutritional characteristics &#8212; more vitamin A, life-saving stuff. The product has been ready to go since 2002, but has been delayed by advocacy groups like Greenpeace. Now, <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=6&amp;fid=9136417&amp;jid=EDE&amp;volumeId=-1&amp;issueId=-1&amp;aid=9136416&amp;bodyId=&amp;membershipNumber=&amp;societyETOCSession=&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S1355770X1300065X">two economists estimate</a> that the delay has, over the past decade, cost 1.4 million life years in India, or about 2 billion US dollars.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.gwern.net/In%20Defense%20Of%20Inclusionism">Is bureaucracy killing Wikipedia?</a> &#8220;The most successful candidates were those who edited the Wikipedia policy or project space; such an edit is worth ten article edits.&#8221;</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/17/what-universal-human-experiences-are-you-missing-without-realizing-it/">The tale of a boy who didn&#8217;t realize he was unable to smell until the age of 14.</a></p></li>

<li><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirah%C3%A3_people">Pirahã people</a> &#8212; a tribe of Amazon natives &#8212; are able to whistle their language and, curiously, &#8220;The language does not have words for precise numbers, but rather concepts for a small amount and a larger amount.&#8221; They would make good physicists.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2014/03/why-do-we-think-p-ne-np-inspired-by.html">Why P doesn&#8217;t equal NP</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/andrewhillecon/files/Hill_GirlNextDoor_Jan2014.pdf?attredirects=1">&#8220;This paper finds that the share of opposite gender friends has a sizable negative effect on high school GPA.&#8221;</a> Lest you jump to conclusions and blame sex-crazed teenage boys, the effect size is significantly larger for females.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/03/18/289013884/who-had-richer-parents-doctors-or-arists">Artists tend to have wealthier parents than doctors.</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1198/what-videos-should-everybody-watch">What theoretical computer science videos should everyone watch?</a></p></li>

<li><p>I&#8217;ve <a href="https://rs.io/the-secretary-problem-explained-dating/">written before</a> about a mathematical problem, the secretary problem, that (naively) suggests people date too few people before marriage. In economics, the idea that people make rational choices regarding marriage is called the &#8220;efficient marriage market hypothesis.&#8221; <a href="http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/48704/1/41266.pdf">Modern marriage markets are about 80% efficient.</a></p></li>
