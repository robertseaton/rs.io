      <description>Tyler Cowen has written a post on a paper about the life satisfaction of economists. It&amp;#8217;s a horrible paper. I don&amp;#8217;t like it at all.
Here are some reasons:
 The authors use satisfaction and happiness interchangeably. They are not the same construct and it will confuse those not familiar with the existing literature. The sample is taken from a few mailing lists of European economists. The study measures life satisfaction with a single question.</description>

      <description>Ohlsen, Ponten, and Hamburt (1978) noted that twenty-five of seventy-one women in their study were receiving psychiatric treatment prior to a breast augmentation procedure, whereas only three continued to do so after the operation.1 Klassen and his colleagues (1996) also found substantial reductions in psychiatric symptomatology among people receiving plastic surgery.2 Cole and his colleagues (1994) reported that 73 percent of their patients reported a higher quality of life after cosmetic surgery, compared to only 6 percent who reported a lower quality of life.</description>

      <description>This is a review and summary of David Myers&amp;#8217;s The Pursuit of Happiness.
General Thoughts on the Book in General, Generally The book is pretty good. I gave it a four out of five stars on Goodreads. If you&amp;#8217;re looking for an answer to the question, &amp;#8220;Who is happy?&amp;#8221; and are not interested in reading more rigorous texts, then this is a good place to start. If you&amp;#8217;re interested in the more pragmatic question, &amp;#8220;How can I become happier?</description>

The book is by Michael Argyle.
Notes on notes I didn&amp;#8217;t bother taking notes on parts of the book that contained information covered more thoroughly elsewhere or where the author&amp;#8217;s claims struck me as dubious. I also spent a while hunting down citations and then quit about half way through, figuring blogging ought to be fun.</description>

Happiness: Lessons from a New Science Summary What is the problem? Jeremy Bentham was a shy and kindly man, who never married and gave his money to good causes. He was also one of the first intellectuals to go jogging &amp;#8211; or trotting as he called it.</description>
