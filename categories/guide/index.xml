      <description>There is no clean, &amp;#8220;one size fits all&amp;#8221; answer to the question, &amp;#8220;Where is the best place to buy land for homesteading?&amp;#8221; Any answer requires careful consideration of the preferences of the asker: I have a very good friend who is tragically allergic to anything green. Pollen torments him as a nightmare&amp;#8217;s take on pixie dust. He mows the lawn and his skin cracks into sores. &amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;d do well in the desert, or on a mountain,&amp;#8221; I tell him.</description>
