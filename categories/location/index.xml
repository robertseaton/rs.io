      <description>Houses in this country can be had for far cheaper than almost anyone realizes. My favorite such example comes from Upstate NY native Christopher Baus: &amp;#8220;The house I was born in sold for $4000.&amp;#8221;
 The house my parents owned when I was born recently sold for $4000. I&amp;#8217;m not omitting a zero or two. That&amp;#8217;s about the price of a used 2001 Honda Civic with 150,000 miles â€“ maybe the Honda is worth a bit more.</description>

      <description>Ever wonder how remote you can go without sacrificing internet connectivity? A couple months back, while working on what eventually evolved into my &amp;#8220;cheap houses, great internet&amp;#8221; discovery service, I mashed together some publicly available federal data to answer just that. By cross-referencing the FCC&amp;#8217;s broadband deployment data against county level statistics for population density, I generated a ranking of counties with symmetric gigabit fiber sorted by remoteness.
The winner?</description>

      <title>Where is Homeschooling Most Popular? States By the Numbers</title>

      <description>Surprisingly, no one has published homeschooling rates per capita for different states, so I&amp;#8217;ve mashed together some census data to figure that out. Unfortunately, only about half of the states publish how many homeschoolers there are in their state.
Initially I tried using an estimate for the other states but the results didn&amp;#8217;t feel plausible, so I&amp;#8217;ve decided to stick with the states I have actual data for.
