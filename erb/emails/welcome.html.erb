  <p>I have done some informal polling and found that only those in the very tippy
top percentile Wonderfulness, the
very-official-psychological-category-that-I&rsquo;m-definitely-not-making-up-right-now,
ever make it here. Statistically, if you&rsquo;re reading this you are among the most
wonderful people in the world.  This may be hard to believe but, well, that&rsquo;s
science for you. The calculations I&rsquo;ve done are very rigorous and the results
are inarguable: You are wonderful.</p>

<p>To commemerate your <del>initiation</del> subscription, I&rsquo;ve painstakingly knit you this
virtual t-shirt:</p>

<p>Since you were cool enough to trust me with your email, I&rsquo;ll tell you something
embarrassing about me: the first time I ate cannabis, I called 911 because I
thought I was going to die. I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it in a future email,
maybe. (If you gotta know, it was exactly like this.) I&rsquo;ve got a bunch of other cool stuff planned first, though.</p>

<p>Talk soon,
robb</p>
