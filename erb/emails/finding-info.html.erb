  

<p>The #1 thing on my list of
stuff-someone-really-ought-to-have-already-told-you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most books and scientific papers can be downloaded from
<a href="http://gen.lib.rus.ec/">gen.lib.rus.ec</a>, for free. If it&rsquo;s available on the internet, you can almost always find
it there in what is either &ldquo;an awe-inspiring act of altruism or a massive criminal
enterprise, depending on whom you ask.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After I&rsquo;d written that down, I
started thinking, &ldquo;Why stop there, at books? Why not codify how to find <em>anything</em> on
the web?&rdquo; I worked on a guide for that for a bit and then realized <strong>this topic would make a suh-weet flowchart.</strong></p>

<p>To use the chart, just follow along down the graph until you&rsquo;ve either found whatever
{book, movie, software, file, etc.} you&rsquo;re
looking for or reached the end. What each node requires exactly may not be obvious from the graphic
alone; the steps are covered in more detail below.</p>

<h2 id="finding-books-and-academic-papers">Finding books &amp; academic papers</h2>

<p>Again, most books and scientific papers can be downloaded from
<a href="http://gen.lib.rus.ec/">gen.lib.rus.ec</a>, for free.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:fn-1"><a href="#fn:fn-1">1</a></sup> If it&rsquo;s available on the internet, you can almost always find
it there in what is either &ldquo;an awe-inspiring act of altruism or a massive criminal
enterprise, depending on whom you ask.&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="try-google">Try Google</h5>

<p>You can also find books by searching Google for <code>&lt;book name&gt;
filetype:pdf</code>. However, it&rsquo;s rarely the case that this tact will turn up something that isn&rsquo;t already available via Library Genesis.</p>

<h5 id="request-an-inter-library-loan">Request an inter-library loan</h5>

<p>A book doesn&rsquo;t need to be listed in your library&rsquo;s networked catalog
in order for you to borrow it. A librarian, asked politely, can request if for
you via inter-library loan.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure how these work. They seem to be routed <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/">through WorldCat</a>,
with librarians allowed access to
<a href="https://firstsearch.oclc.org/FSIP">more powerful search tools</a> than the publicly available one.</p>

<h5 id="get-notified-when-a-used-copy-is-listed-to-amazon">Get notified when a used copy is listed to Amazon</h5>

<p><a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/">CamelCamelCamel</a> can alert you when a product falls below a set price on
Amazon. If you don&rsquo;t need a book right away, you can use this to watch for and snag a cheap copy whenever it&rsquo;s listed.</p>

<h2 id="for-everything-else-there-s-bittorrent">For everything else, there&rsquo;s BitTorrent</h2>

<p>If you
have, say, a nephew that supplies you with seemingly any {movie, tv show, software},
he&rsquo;s probably downloading it via BitTorrent. ~5% of all Internet traffic is due
to the file-sharing protocol.</p>

<p>Using it is much less complicated than you may imagine. You too can access files
shared through BitTorrent.</p>

<h5 id="here-s-how">Here&rsquo;s how&ndash;</h5>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://deluge-torrent.org/">Install Deluge.</a></li>
<li>Search for whatever you want on <a href="https://thepiratebay.org/">The Pirate Bay.</a></li>
<li>Download the <code>.torrent</code> file and open it with Deluge.</li>
<li>Wait while Deluge downloads it for you.</li>
<li><em>Viola!</em> You&rsquo;re done.</li>
</ol>

<p>Directions unclear? <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Deluge">Here&rsquo;s a more detailed guide.</a></p>

<h3 id="when-it-s-not-on-the-pirate-bay">When it&rsquo;s not on The Pirate Bay</h3>

<p>The Pirate Bay is the largest and most infamous example of a <code>.torrent</code>
indexer; even so, its catalog spans only a fraction of all of the files shared
via BitTorrent.</p>

<p>Other indexers include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://torrentz2.eu/">torrentz2.eu</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rutracker.org/forum/index.php">rutracker.org</a></li>
<li><a href="https://yts.ae/">yts.ae</a> (movies)</li>
<li><a href="https://1337x.to/">1337x.to</a></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="try-google-1">Try Google</h5>

<p>Sometimes a Google search will turn up whatever you couldn&rsquo;t find. Use a query like <code>&lt;whatever&gt; filetype:torrent</code> or <code>&lt;whatever&gt; intitle:torrent</code>.</p>

<h5 id="pre-databases">Pre-databases</h5>

<p>Pre-databases are how you answer the question, &ldquo;Is this thing even freely
available somewhere on the internet?&rdquo; These databases track ~every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warez%5Fscene">Scene</a>
release, so searching one can determine if whatever
you&rsquo;re looking for has ever been shared by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warez%5Fgroup">Warez group</a>.</p>

<p>If it isn&rsquo;t listed in
a pre-database, the answer is &ldquo;probably not,&rdquo; meaning further searching is a waste of
time and you should just buy whatever you&rsquo;re seeking.</p>

<p>Here are some you can check&ndash;</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://predb.me/">predb.me</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pre.corrupt-net.org/">pre.corrupt-net.org</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, these sites answer <em>if</em>
something can be found and nothing about <em>where</em>. They maintain a record of
what has been released and by which group. That&rsquo;s all. They exist primarily
as a scoreboard for the complex intra-group status competition that takes place
between Warez groups. That they&rsquo;re useful to us is largely incidental.</p>

<h5 id="private-trackers">Private trackers</h5>

<p>Many of the files shared on BitTorrent are available only to members of private,
invite-only websites. Getting invited typically requires either knowing a guy or
an account in good standing on a sister-site.</p>

<p>There are two notable exceptions&ndash;</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://iptorrents.com/signup.php">IPTorrents</a>, one of the largest private <code>.torrent</code> trackers, sells accounts for a $20 &ldquo;donation.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Private music-tracker RED is open to anyone who can <a href="https://interviewfor.red/en/index.html">pass an interview on IRC</a>. If you then reach &ldquo;power-user status&rdquo; on the site, you can request access to
other private trackers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Realistically, securing broad access to the ever-shifting coalition of private
<code>.torrent</code> communities requires at least months of careful planning, plus an ongoing
couple hours / week even once you&rsquo;re &ldquo;in.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll need hobbyist-level
dedication but it can be fun for the sort of person who would enjoy roleplaying as
Neo at the beginning of <em>The Matrix</em>.</p>

<h3 id="usenet">Usenet</h3>

<p>BitTorrent is <em>peer-to-peer</em> filesharing, and this is why its communities end up
so secretive. You&rsquo;re downloading directly from the guy sharing it: he&rsquo;s exposing
his identity to you, so he&rsquo;s going to require some sort of guarantee that you&rsquo;re
cool. He&rsquo;s also going to want you to share your files with him in return;
otherwise, why bother?<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:fn-2"><a href="#fn:fn-2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Imagine if, instead, every user paid $10/mo to a company to act as a
middleman. The company would use the cash to provision a massive data center and from
then on, users would upload and download to and from this company&rsquo;s communal pool,
rather than interact directly with each other. Peers no longer need to vet or
trust each other, because everything flows through the middleman.</p>

<h4 id="a-utopian-fantasy-impossible-surely-illegal-no-it-s-usenet-dot">A utopian fantasy? Impossible? Surely illegal? No, it&rsquo;s Usenet.</h4>

<p>Usenet is what you get when you answer BitTorrent&rsquo;s trust-based coordination
issues with, &ldquo;what if we just paid somebody to sit in the middle and host
everything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The result is a sweet, sweet <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/7d9o9o/how%5Fmany%5Fterabytes%5Fin%5Fthe%5Fworld%5Fare%5Fdevoted%5Fto/">~750 petabytes</a> of copyright infringing bits. Data which, unlike BitTorrent, you don&rsquo;t need an
invite, an interview, or a secret passphrase to access. You just gotta pay the
middleman his ~$13 toll.</p>

<h5 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it</h5>

<p>Architecture aside, downloading files from Usenet is very similar to BitTorrent,
practically speaking. You
search one of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/wiki/indexers">these indexers</a>, where you download <code>.nzb</code> files instead of
<code>.torrent</code> files, which you then load into <a href="https://nzbget.net/">NZBGet</a> instead of Deluge.</p>

<p>Before NZBGet&rsquo;ll work, though, you&rsquo;ll need access to Usenet&rsquo;s data. You purchase
that by signing up with a newsgroup provider; newsgroup providers are the
&ldquo;middleman company&rdquo; mentioned earlier, except there are actually a bunch of them,
not just one.</p>

<h5 id="my-recommendation">My recommendation</h5>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about any of this unless there&rsquo;s something on Usenet that you
want. You can check by searching <a href="http://findnzb.net/">findnzb.net</a>.</p>

<p>If whatever you&rsquo;re seeking is on there, you can download it by subscribing to
<a href="https://www.newshosting.com/?a%5Faid=rsio&amp;a%5Fbid=5ecfe99b">Newshosting</a> and taking advantage of their <a href="https://www.newshosting.com/free-usenet.php?a%5Faid=rsio&amp;a%5Fbid=5ecfe99b">14-day free trial</a>. You get two weeks
and 30GB before you&rsquo;re charged for anything. If whatever you&rsquo;re trying to
download fits inside
that envelope, it can be had for free.</p>
