<li><p><a href="http://genetics.thetech.org/ask-a-geneticist/polydactyly">The mutation for six instead of five fingers is dominant.</a> The good news: children of the future will type faster.

<li><p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886914000919">Study finds jazz musicians are more creative than those in other genres.</a> I <em>was</em> going to use this as an opportunity to trumpet the innate superiority of jazz musicians over classicists, but then I thought hey &#8212; maybe they&#8217;re more creative because they practice being creative. Lo and behold, <a href="http://www.gwern.net/Drug%20heuristics">unlike IQ</a>, <a href="http://gettingsorted.homestead.com/Scott__et_al__2004_Creativity_Training.pdf">creativity can be improved with training and the gains are transferable.</a> HT: <a href="http://hbdchick.wordpress.com/">hbd* chick</a>.</p></li>

It means &#8220;Buffalo bison that other Buffalo bison bully, themselves bully Buffalo bison.&#8221; Maybe this illustrates the limits of grammatical correctness?Â  My third-grade teacher told me, &#8220;You can start a sentence with &#8216;and&#8217; when you&#8217;re a best-selling author.&#8221; And now I do it whenever I want.</p></li>

I dated a girl once whose parents thought that bad dreams were spiritual warfare. If I thought that dreaming I was a giant donut was <em>literally the work of the devil</em>, I&#8217;d be freaked out, too.</p></li>

<li><p>A psychology graduate student, three psychologists, a pediatrician, a psychiatrist, a painter and a housewife with no history of mental illness gain entrance into psychiatric hospitals around the country by pretending to hear voices.
