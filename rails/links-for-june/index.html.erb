        The white privilege meme mostly just reduces concern for poor whites: <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-22926-001">&#8220;We conclude that, among social liberals, White privilege lessons may increase beliefs that poor White people have failed to take advantage of their racial privilege—leading to negative social evaluations.&#8221;</a> My maximally cynical take is that this is it working as intended. Egalitarians are the first to sneer at anyone poor, rural, or heavily accented so long as they&#8217;re white–it&#8217;s a tribal shibboleth. Conservatives worry about being mistaken for a black person; progressives worry about being mistaken for the wrong class of white person.
