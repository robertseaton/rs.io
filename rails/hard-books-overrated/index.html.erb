<p>Widely used calculus books must be mediocre.</p>

<p><span id="quote-attribute">â€” W. Rudin</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve noticed a phenomenon, especially in mathematics, where anyone asking for book recommendations invariably is recommended the least-gentle-but-still-reasonable textbook imaginable. A high school student might ask for an introduction to calculus and someone will tell them to read <em>Principles of Mathematical Analysis</em>. Looking for an introduction to programming? Hey, try <em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em> &#8212; or just read Knuth!</p>

<p>Several possible explanations spring to mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>By recommending a difficult book to someone, you&#8217;re signalling your own intelligence.</li>
<li>Struggling against a text results in a sort of Stockholm syndrome, where one becomes more fond of it as they sink more hours into it.</li>
<li>Recommending an easy book can be socially costly as the receiver might interpret it as an insult. It&#8217;s safer to recommend a hard book.</li>
<li>When asked for a book recommendation, people mentally grasp the book most representative of that subject, and this leads to a bias towards not-beginner-friendly texts.</li>
<li>Hard texts are that much better than anything else.</li>
<li>Familiarity with a subject damages one&#8217;s ability to judge whether or not a text is appropriate for someone without the same background.</li>
<li>Those recommending hard textbooks have not, generally, tried to self-study them, but rather sat through a class that required the text and completed 10% of the problems as homework.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these could be true, but what we really want to know is: are hard books systematically overvalued?</p>

<h2 id="comparing-the-utility-of-books">Comparing the utility of books</h2>

<p>Now, I have no doubt that reading one hard book is more valuable than reading one easy book, but that&#8217;s not a fair fight. I could get through <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> in a couple of days, while working through Knuth&#8217;s <em>Concrete Mathematics</em> would take me the better part of a year. If you accept that a book like <em>Concrete Mathematics</em> can take 200 hours while an easy book might take 4, the question becomes: Is one hard book worth fifty easy ones?</p>

<h3 id="microeconomics">Microeconomics</h3>

<p>We can consider taking this completely literally. Consider perhaps the most straightforward application of microeconomic theory ever: If two men are selling rugs, but one man is able to sell his rugs for ten times as much, well, customers are deriving more value from his rugs.</p>

<p>50 easy books will, most of the time, cost more than 1 hard book. We might expect, then, that 50 easy books will provide more value to the consumer. I actually have painstakingly collected statistics on my own reading, but there&#8217;s no correlation between my rating of a book and its price (alas).</p>

<p><a href="https://rs.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/books-price-rating-correlation.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-474" src="https://rs.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/books-price-rating-correlation.png" alt="books-price-rating-correlation" width="545" height="501" srcset="https://rs.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/books-price-rating-correlation.png 545w, https://rs.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/books-price-rating-correlation-300x275.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" /></a>A stroll through the New York Times&#8217;s best seller list also reveals no obvious relationship between how interesting a book looks and its price. A look at computer science and programming books is a bit more compelling. The obviously more valuable books (e.g. <em>The Art of Computer Programming</em>) are selling for more than the nth Adobe Photoshop manual.</p>

<p>So easy books win here, but it&#8217;s not clear if this win is worth anything.</p>

<h3 id="amount-learned">Amount learned</h3>

<p>Instead, we can take the tack of estimating the amount learned from a book. When going through <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>, I learned maybe 10 things. Today, I started reading Petzold&#8217;s <em>CODE</em> and have taken about 50 separate notes. At this rate, I should end up with something like 300. A significant variance here, but let&#8217;s say the average easy text can teach someone 35 new things &#8212; more if you&#8217;re careful with book selection.</p>

<p>If I consider, on the other hand, a harder text, like <em>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</em>, the amount available to learn is about an order of magnitude greater. Depending on the number of exercises one wades through, anywhere between one and three thousand seems reasonable.</p>

<p>This one could really go either way. A broad selection of fifty popular science texts will teach a person more than one really hard book, but one hard book will teach you more than fifty so-so spiritual or diet books.</p>

<p>And, of course, all learning is not created equal. Some things really are more important than others.</p>

<p>Possible heuristic: popular science is great for building a broad understanding, while difficult works are great for pushing one to the next level via deliberate practice.</p>

<h3 id="revealed-preference">Revealed preference</h3>

<p>I can count the number of people I know who routinely fight their way through hard books on one hand. It&#8217;s not a normal thing that people do, even curious people. Indeed, curious people are notable for being more willing than most to read a wide variety of texts, not for the difficulty of those texts.</p>

<h3 id="university-courses">University courses</h3>

<p>University professors typically assign more difficult textbooks (although often not truly difficult, a sorta middle ground.) Still, consider the popularity of a book like CLRS versus <em>The Algorithm Design Manual</em>. The first is more popular, the second more readable.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure who wins this round: on the one hand, university textbooks are harder to read than what&#8217;s on the New York Times bestsellers list. On the other hand, most university courses are not requiring books like <em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em>, instead opting for something gentler.</p>

<p>Plus, these medium difficulty textbooks are often little more than props for a class, something to accompany lectures and provide exercises. Still, on the whole, it seems more honest to call this a win for difficult books.</p>

<h3 id="comprehension-amount-retained">Comprehension, amount retained</h3>

<p>On difficult texts, one Less Wrong commenter <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ihy/how_valuable_is_it_to_learn_math_deeply/">wrote this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I found that when a text requires a second or third reading, taking a lot of notes, etc., I won&#8217;t be able to master it at the level of the material that I know well, and it won&#8217;t be retained as reliably, for example I won&#8217;t be able to re-generate most of the key constructions and theorems without looking them up a couple of years later (this applies even if more advanced topics are practiced in the meantime, as they usually don&#8217;t involve systematic review of the basics). Thus, there is a triple penalty for working on challenging material: it takes more effort and time to process, the resulting understanding is less fluent, and it gets forgotten faster and to a greater extent.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="success">Success</h3>

<p>If we live in a world where hard books were clearly superior to easier ones, I would expect that the reading habits of successful people would center around difficult books.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t the impression that I get, in general. CEOs fill their reading lists with biographies, not textbooks. If you looked at <a href="http://www.gatesnotes.com/Books">the reading habits of Bill Gates</a>, you&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s filled with popular non-fiction rather than hefty technical works.</p>

<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h2>

<p>All of this suggests a heuristic: <strong>to decide what to read, ask yourself, &#8220;What&#8217;s the easiest book I could read that will teach me a lot?&#8221;</strong> Or, alternatively, &#8220;What&#8217;s the easiest book that will move me towards my goals?&#8221;</p>

<p>For reading broadly, popular works seem like a clear win. I think it&#8217;s best to save difficult works in a field until you&#8217;ve reached diminishing returns on easier texts. If you&#8217;re not learning much, then you ought to move onto something harder.</p>

<p>Ideally, the process of reading through easy texts on a subject before tackling harder ones transforms once difficult books into easy ones. This pattern of reading looks more like a slow progression than a violent struggle &#8212; small steps instead of leaps.</p>
