  <h1>The men who were most in life owned little or nothing</h1>

  <blockquote>
<p>Revolutionaries, artists, and seers are content to be objective, merely objective: they know that desire clasps life in its powerfully productive embrace, and reproduces it in a way that is all the more intense because it has few needs. And never mind those who believe that this is very easy to say, or that it is the sort of idea to be found in books. &#8220;From the little reading I had done I had observed that the men who were most in life, who were moulding life, who were life itself, ate little, slept little, owned little or nothing. They had no illusions about duty, or the perpetuation of their kith and kin, or the preservation of the State&hellip; . The phantasmal world is the world which has never been fully conquered over. It is the world of the past, never of the future. To move forward clinging to the past is like dragging a ball and chain.&#8221;</p>

<p>–Deleuze &amp; Guattari, <a href="https://amzn.to/2N3BNJn"><em>Anti-Oedipus</em></a></p>

<p>They are quoting Henry Miller here, from his <a href="https://amzn.to/2H9yWea"><em>Sexus: The Rosy Crucifixion I</em></a>, which disappointingly has not been uploaded to the web beyond this slightly longer snippet:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the little reading I had done I had observed that the men who were most in life, who were molding life, who were life itself, ate little, slept little, owned little or nothing. They had no illusions about duty, or the perpetuation of their kith and kin, or the preservation of the State. They were interested in truth and in truth alone. They recognized only one kind of activity &#8211; creation.</p>
