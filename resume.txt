# PAST & CURRENT PROGRAMMING PROJECTS

    [nine]                   (https://github.com/robertseaton/nine)
    A userspace, compatibility-layer that enables native binaries from Plan 9
    From Bell Labs to run on top of an unmodified Linux kernel. Work on this
    project stems from previous work on the Glendix set of kernel patches, 
    which modify the Linux kernel to allow Plan 9 binaries to be executed.

    [Slug]                   (https://github.com/robertseaton/slug)
    A lightweight, scriptable BitTorrent client that allows power users to 
    automate many common, but tedious tasks involved in the management of 
    large numbers of torrents.

    [Plan 9 From Gentoo]     (http://soc.dev.gentoo.org/~rps/plan9/)
    Plan 9 From Gentoo is a Google Summer of Code 2011 project to overlay a Plan 
    9-inspired userspace on top of a Gentoo base system. The project is inspired 
    by and builds on the work of Plan 9 From Bell Labs.
