  <h1>Rural Areas with Good Internet Speeds (for Streaming, Gaming, Remote Work)</h1>

  <p>Ever wonder how remote you can go without sacrificing internet connectivity?</p>

<p>A couple months back, I mashed together some publicly available federal data to answer just that. By cross-referencing the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/explanation-broadband-deployment-data">FCC&#8217;s broadband deployment data</a> against <a href="https://www2.census.gov/census_2010/01-Redistricting_File--PL_94-171/">county level statistics for population density</a>, I generated a ranking of counties with symmetric gigabit fiber sorted by remoteness.</p>

<p>The winner?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a tie actually. Carter County, Montana and Kenedy County, Texas. The dataset calculates a population density of 0.3 people per square mile for both.</p>

<p>Or so I thought, until I realized I could cheat and look up more precise numbers on Wikipedia to break the tie. Drum roll, please…</p>

<div id="outline-container-org08198d6" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="org08198d6">
    The results
  </h2>
  
  <div id="text-org08198d6" class="outline-text-2">
    <p>
      Kenedy County Texas is #1! With a mere 416 people populating almost 2,000 square miles, they somehow manage to have gigabit fiber available through <a href="http://www.vtx1.net/">VTX Communications.</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.rangeweb.net/residential/high-speed-internet/">Range Telephone Cooperative</a> in Carter County Montana is #2, with ~1,100 people on ~3,300 square miles.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The final ranking ended up with more than 2600 entries, unfortunately, so it&#8217;s kind of overwhelming but I&#8217;ve reproduced it in the table below. You can also <a href="https://rs.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/rural_broadband_by_county_density.csv">download the data set by clicking here</a>.

      Whenever you&#8217;re done gorging yourself on the heady rush that is sorted data, I&#8217;ll talk specifics about a couple of especially promising rural areas with good internet&#8230;

      Chattanooga has been <a href="http://chattanoogagig.com/">branding itself as &#8220;the Gig city,&#8221;</a> ever since its regional electrical company, <a href="https://epb.com/">EPB</a>, ran gigabit fiber to its customer base in 2010. This created the US&#8217;s largest fiber grid, spanning ~600 square miles. Meaning, don&#8217;t let the word &#8220;city&#8221; here turn you off. Sure, it covers Chattanooga, but their network extends out into the country and even across state lines into neighboring Georgia. (<a href="https://epb.com/outage-map">This</a> is the <a href="https://epb.com/outage-map">map of their entire coverage area</a>.)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Now, it&#8217;s pretty damn cool that they serve all of this territory symmetric gigabit but it&#8217;s cooler still that they do it at a cost to subscribers of less than $70/month. The craziest thing, though, is what EPB did to their grid in 2015: they upgraded Chattanooga from &#8220;the Gig city&#8221; to &#8220;the 10 Gig city,&#8221; along with the rest of their network.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>That&#8217;s right. EPB will sell you a symmetric 10Gb/s internet pipe and they&#8217;ll run it way out into the country.</b> It&#8217;s $300/mo but, hey, they&#8217;re the only residential provider offering it in the United States <i>at all</i>. The rest of the country&#8217;s <i>best</i> is a tenth the speed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Insane. EPB and the rest of you crazy bastards in Tennessee, I salute you. Can&#8217;t wait to hear about what y&#8217;all come up with next.

      I initially stumbled onto EPB while looking for raw land without building codes that was also served gigabit fiber. The bit of EPB&#8217;s grid that ventures into Sequatchie County, TN, is just such a region. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s the bourgeois expensive area known as &#8220;Signal Mountain.&#8221; Folk are asking for 10 grand/acre, which is <i>hefty</i> for Appalachia. Too rich for me. I had to expand my search.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The result: Morgan County, MO, and their ISP, <a href="https://www.co-mo.net/residential/internet-for-residential/">Co-Mo.net</a>. Co-Mo actually covers more than just Morgan county but what&#8217;s cool about Morgan county is that it&#8217;s blissfully free of building codes, as long as your property isn&#8217;t on the lake. Plus, if you own more than 5 acres, you can choose to waive even septic permitting and compost your own waste, like via a humanure system.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It&#8217;s more rural than EPB and it&#8217;s <i>cheap</i>, too. You can sometimes find parcels for $1500/acre. (Most of the cheapest listings are in the neighborhood called Ivy Bend and I&#8217;ve heard from locals that this area is sort of sketchy. I&#8217;m not sure whether they mean &#8220;weird and poor neighbors&#8221; sketchy or &#8220;theft and violent crime&#8221; sketchy. It&#8217;s no real problem either way, as I pretty frequently see cheap acreage for sale in the &#8220;nicer&#8221;, Eastern part of the county too.)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I&#8217;ve written before, too, about the particular promise of the Ozarks for homesteading, like in <a href="https://rs.io/the-best-place-to-buy-land-for-homesteading/">my guide on selecting the best place to buy homesteading land</a>.

    How to Find More Rural Areas With Good Internet

      If none of the above are what you&#8217;re looking for, the next thing you&#8217;ll want to do is scroll through <a href="https://muninetworks.org/content/rural-cooperatives-page">this list of rural internet cooperatives</a> and make a list of the companies operating in your preferred region. Then, Google each cooperative from your list and make notes on things like:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>
        Extent of service area
      </li>
      <li>
        Status of current project. Is the grid running and complete? Partially online and still expanding? Not up yet and under construction? Only just announced?
      </li>
      <li>
        Price, speed.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you&#8217;re planning on developing raw land, be sure you determine what is required to hook a new parcel to the co-op&#8217;s grid. Sometimes it&#8217;s impossible or tens of thousands of dollars. Don&#8217;t get burned!
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      A similar tact you can try, if you&#8217;re unable to find anything in your area that way, is to start your initial list by Googling &#8220;<your state> internet cooperative&#8221; and then digging more into whatever that search finds.
